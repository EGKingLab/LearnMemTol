## To do


## Analysis Workflow 

1. Process raw data for learning, memory, and thermal tolerance
  - Learning and Memory
      - Processed data from HeatCalc is parsed using a perl script (heatcalcRead_LearnMem.pl) and outputs: HeatProc_Learn.txt
      - Raw .asc files are processed using an R script (process_raw_learnmem.R) to identify any other issues (see Step 2)
  - Thermal tolerance
      - Raw .asc files are processed using an R script (process_raw_therm.R) to identify issues and calculate thermal tolerance for each individual
      - Validation of thermotolerance method is validate_incapacitation.R      

2. Raw data and processed data are checked using check_raw_data.Rmd. Notes within this script.

## Notes

A record of notes in the style of a lab notebook

### July 9

- Finalize dataset for mapping. We decided as a group to eliminate flies that were incapacitated on the punishment side and never resumed moving after that. See check_raw_data.Rmd for notes.

### June 18 

- Starting git and this record. Old notes will be moved over. 
- Checked raw processing scripts. 
- Checked validation script for incapacitation.
