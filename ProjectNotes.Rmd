## To do


## Analysis Workflow 

1. Process raw data for learning, memory, and thermal tolerance
  - Learning and Memory
      - Processed data from HeatCalc is parsed using a perl script (heatcalcRead_LearnMem.pl) and outputs: HeatProc_Learn.txt
      - Raw .asc files are processed using an R script to identify any other issues (see Step 2)
  - Thermal tolerance
      - Raw .asc files are processed using an R script to identify issues and calculate thermal tolerance for each individual
      - Validation of thermotolerance method is validate_incapacitation.R      

## Notes

A record of notes in the style of a lab notebook
