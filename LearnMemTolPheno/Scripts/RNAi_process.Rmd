```

## Read in processed data

```{r}

ThermDat <- readRDS(file="../ProcessedData/Incap_processed.Rds")
str(ThermDat)

```

## Data Checking

Use `unique()` to check groups, replicates, genotypes, etc. for issues. You will need a column that specifies which flies you want to compare so work toward getting that set up here and checking for any problems. Use `tally()` to count up how many you have in your groups to make sure that makes sense too. Etc.

The raw file is BIG so I haven't uploaded it yet. Will when I am on campus. We can look at any traces if you think we need to.
