## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(DSPRqtl)
library(DSPRqtlDataA)
library(tidyverse)
```



## read in LearnMem processed raw data and check 

```{r}
#rawd <- read.table("/MyGitHub/LearnMemTol/Data/HeatProc.txt",sep="\t", #header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

rawdLM <- read.table("../Data/HeatProc_Learn.txt",sep="\t", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


str(rawdLM)

```


## read in ThermTol processed raw data and check
```{r}
rawdTT <- read.table("../Data/ThermalTol_processed.txt",sep="\t", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


str(rawdTT)

```


## find means and SEMs for all three traits

```{r}
L_MDATA <- rawdLM %>% 
  group_by(patRIL) %>% 
  summarise(Learning_Mean = mean(Learning),
            Learning_SEM = sd(Learning)/sqrt(length(Learning)),
            Memory_Mean = mean(Memory),
            Memory_SEM = sd(Memory)/sqrt(length(Memory)),
            N = length(Memory))

T_TDATA <- rawdT_T %>% 
  group_by(patRIL) %>% 
  summarise(Learning_Mean = mean(Learning),
            Learning_SEM = sd(Learning)/sqrt(length(Learning)),
            Memory_Mean = mean(Memory),
            Memory_SEM = sd(Memory)/sqrt(length(Memory)),
            N = length(Memory))
```
